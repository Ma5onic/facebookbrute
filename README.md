# facebookbrute
Brute forces facebook accounts

To install facebookbrute all you need to do is run this command

chmod +x setup.py && ./setup.py && chmod +x facebookbrute.py

Now you need to setup the config file you need to specify the username and wordlist,
after that you type.

./facebookbrute.py

You might need to add nameserver 8.8.8.8 to /etc/resolv.conf 

And it will crack the password

Enjoy!!
